GenAI Table Creator - Hackathon Project
This project contains a simple web application with a Python Flask backend.

Setup and Installation
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

pip (Python package installer).

2. Install Dependencies
This project requires the Flask library. Open your terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory and run:

pip install Flask

How to Run the Application
Make sure you are in the root directory of the project (the same folder where app.py is located).

Run the following command in your terminal:

python app.py

You will see output indicating that the server is running, usually on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Open your web browser and navigate to the joke page to start:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/joke

Click on the drawer to see the animation and be redirected to the main application at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Ideas for Your GenAI App (Hackathon Brainstorm)
Image to Table:

Use an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library in Python (like Tesseract) to extract text from the image.

Use a simple language model (or even just regex and heuristics for a hackathon) to identify the table structure (rows, columns) from the raw OCR text.

Natural Language to Table:

Add an input where a user can type "Create a table with columns for Name, Email, and Age".

Your GenAI backend would parse this to generate the table headers.

Table Editing with AI:

Add a "Magic Fill" button. A user could highlight a column (e.g., "Country") and type "USA", and the AI could suggest filling the rest of the rows with other countries.

"Data Cleaning" feature: An AI button that automatically formats dates consistently, corrects common typos, or standardizes capitalization.

Export Feature:

Add a button to export the final, edited table as a CSV or Excel file. This is a great feature to showcase.
